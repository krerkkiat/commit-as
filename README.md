# commit-as

Core functionality is the same as

```console
git -c user.name=Name -c user.email=Email commit
```

But this program remembers the list of users, so you can switch between them.

Why? The computer lab at school is a share environment where multiple students may login
to the same account.

## Features

- Make commit as certain known user.
- Set Git's global configuration to certain known user.
